Climate Change and Global Warming

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns. Since the mid-20th century, the dominant driver of climate change has been human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. The primary greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

Greenhouse Effect Mechanism

The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. When the Sun's energy reaches the Earth's atmosphere, some of it is reflected back to space and the rest is absorbed and re-radiated by greenhouse gases. Human activities have intensified this effect by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, leading to global warming.

Climate Impact on Ecosystems

Rising global temperatures affect ecosystems worldwide. Arctic ice is melting at unprecedented rates, sea levels are rising, and weather patterns are becoming more extreme. These changes threaten biodiversity, disrupt food chains, and force species to adapt or migrate to survive changing conditions.

Renewable Energy Solutions

Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power offer sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. These technologies have become increasingly cost-effective and efficient, making them viable solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions while meeting global energy demands.

Climate Adaptation and Mitigation

Climate adaptation involves adjusting natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic changes. Mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit future climate change. Both strategies are essential for addressing climate challenges and building resilient communities.
